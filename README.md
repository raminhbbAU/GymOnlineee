This is an open source project to help freelance trainers to coordinate their courses, athletes, students, payment and so on.

Some freelance trainers prefer to hold their classes online and they have to do some extra management tasks by themselves. So In addition to their technical skills, they need an online platform to keep their athlete's enrollment, payment, and other information. GymOnlineee is a free open-source project for them.
